  <p>The point of the game is to get someone to guess your definition as the correct one. </p>

  <p>You will rotate who is in charge and pass the phone around to the person to your right after your turn.
  During the leaders turn, they will read the chosen word aloud and then start the timer. The leader will then write the defintion on a piece of paper.
  Everyone else will write what they think the word is (or what they can get everyone else to believe is the correct one) on their paper.</p>

  <p>Once the timer is over, everyone will pass/hand their paper to the leader. The leader will read aloud all of the definitions and everyone will vote on the one that they think is correct.</p>
